Some design changes come up during the development process. One of the changes was integrating About Us as a section on Home Page, compared to the initial design to be a separate page.
## Site Structure

The application has 3 main pages: Home, Services, and Contact. It also has several additional pages related to Admin, sign up, sign in and sign out.

## Design Choices

### Typhography

- The font family is 'Poppins' from Google fonts. It is a modern, professional font and does not distract user from content.

### Color Pallet

- The primary color used has a pale tint of azure, and on the website, blue in different shadows and hues are present. Blue is associated with professional and modern aspects and gives the user a calming and familiar look.

## Data Model

- Spotless website is based on MVC model (Model. View, and Controller). It consists of a database with relationships between models (represented by tables in the above image). The models are CustomUser, Booking, Service, and Contact. The views then render the models in a way dictated by the URLs.
