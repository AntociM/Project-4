Some design changes come up during the development process. One of the changes was integrating About Us as a section on Home Page, compared to the initial design to be a separate page.
## Site Structure

The application has three main pages: Home, Services, and Contact. It also has several additional pages related to Admin, sign up, sign in and sign out.

## Design Choices

### Typhography

- The font family is 'Poppins' from Google fonts, and it is a modern, professional font and does not distract users from content.

### Color Pallet

- The primary color used has a pale tint of azure, and on the website, blue in different shadows and hues are present. Blue is associated with professional and modern aspects and gives the user a calming and familiar look.

## Data Model

- Spotless website is based on MVC model (Model. View, and Controller). It consists of a database with relationships between models (represented by tables in the above image). The models are CustomUser, Booking, Service, and Contact. The views then render the models in a way dictated by the URLs.

## Features

### Existing features

#### Home Page

##### Navigation bar

- It is located at the top of every pageâ€”the company's logo on the left-hand side and the menu on the other side. Navigation elements are displayed inline for displays over 750px. The Navigation Bar swifts to a dropdown list for smaller screens, represented by three lines in the top right corner.

![](docs/nav.jpg)

##### Main image and intro

- Located under Navigation is an image chosen to represent the tidiness of a home, with an overlayed intro text. 

![](docs/home-page-print.jpg)

##### Website interaction

- This section lets the user know how can access the wished service. 

##### Our Goal and About Us 
- Structured in 2 separated elements, these sections help the user find more information about the company's history and the values and strives that are representative.

![](docs/About us.jpg)

##### Service Overview
- A responsively styled services display to allow the user a quick overview. Each service has a representative icon next to it. 
- An embedded link will redirect the user to the services page.

![](docs/services-home.jpg)

##### Testimonials

- The testimonials section provides the user with some feedback from past clients. There are three testimonials displayed, giving a picture, feedback, and name.

![](docs/testimonials.jpg)

##### Footer

- Footer has a basic style that displays social media links and copyright information.

![](docs/footer.jpg)

#### Services Page

- At the top of the page is a representative image with overlayed text providing helpful information.
- Fallows an enumeration of services. Each service has a representative icon, description, price/h, and a button redirecting the user to the booking form.

![](docs/service-page.jpg)

#### Contact Page

- Styled in 2 columns (contact form and contact information) in full display and for small screens, content stack on top of each other. 
- On the left-hand side is the contact form, which includes name, email, telephone, title, and message. When a user submits a contact request, the application logs the contact to the database for a record. Initially, all contacts are marked as 'unreplied'. A quick reference to see the contact's status.

![](docs/contact-form.jpg)


#### Sign In page

- The user can log in using his credentials, username, and password. There is a link to the signup form in the case of a new user.

![](docs/login-page.jpg)

- The CustomSign up form extends the Django classic form with extra fields. The user is required to add an address, city housing type (chose from a dropdown list), and house surface in sqm. This information is relevant for calculating the exact price of a service.

![](docs/signup_form.jpg)

#### Additional pages 

- When the user is logged in, he can access his account using 'My Account' link from the navbar. Here the user can make a booking, see booking history and status, update or cancel one booking two days before the booked date. The user can as well update his registration information.    

![](docs/user-profile.jpg)

![](docs/booking-form.jpg)

#### Admin Page

-Admin has access via the default Django Admin page. The Admin panel is accessed from the navigation menu once a superuser has logged in. Admin can add/delete users, update booking status, see the contact received via contact platform, and update the website's content

### Future Feature

- The main feature will be connecting to an email to confirm bookings and to receive email notifications with contact details.
- Automatic booking system based on specific criteria. Currently, there is a manual validation of bookings done by the Admin.
- The website would also benefit from an automatic payment system.
